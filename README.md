# HunleffTimerLite

A keybound activated timer that tracks Hunleff's attack style cycle.

	• F12 to start, F11 to stop.
  
	• Activate the script during the same tick you first get hit/splashed, just like the Runelite plugin.
  
	• No trample functionality. Don't get trampled. If you need it badly, DM me on twitter @chloroken.

Requires AutoHotKey to function. Although it doesn't input any commands and shouldn't break ToS, use at your own risk!
