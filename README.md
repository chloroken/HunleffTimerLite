# Hunleff Timer Lite

A keybound activated timer that tracks Hunleff's attack style cycle. Requires AutoHotKey to function.

DIRECTIONS

	• Run the script with administrator privileges.

	• Default keybinds are: [F5] to start, [F6] to reset.
		
		• Check for conflicts in default Settings -> Controls!
	
		• Check for conflicts with "Key Remapping" Runelite plugin!
  
	• Activate the script the same tick as you first get hit (or splashed).
  
NOTES:

- No trample functionality so...don't get trampled. If you need it badly, DM me on twitter @chloroken.

- Although the script inputs no commands and shouldn't break ToS, use at your own risk!
