# Hunleff Timer Lite

A keybound activated timer that tracks Hunleff's attack style cycle. Requires AutoHotKey to function.

	• KEYBINDS: F5 to start, F6 to reset. Check for conflicts with "Key Remapping" plugin.
  
	• DIRECTIONS: Activate the script during the same tick you first get hit/splashed.
	
	• If the keybind doesn't work or sounds don't play, run the script as an administrator.
  
NOTES:

- No trample functionality so...don't get trampled. If you need it badly, DM me on twitter @chloroken.

- Although the script inputs no commands and shouldn't break ToS, use at your own risk!
