# HunleffTimerLite

A timer to keep track of Hunleff's attack style cycle. Keybind to activate is the main feature.

		• F12 to start, F11 to stop.
  
		• Activate the script during the same tick you first get hit/splashed, just like the Runelite plugin.
  
		• No trample functionality. Don't get trampled. Will add if someone needs it, just DM me on twitter @chloroken.

Requires AutoHotKey to function. Although it doesn't input any commands and shouldn't break ToS, use at your own risk!
