# HunleffTimerLite

A keybound activated timer that tracks Hunleff's attack style cycle. Requires AutoHotKey to function.

	• F9 to start, F10 to reset. Check for conflicts with Runelite hotkeys first ("Key Remapping" plugin).
  
	• Activate the script during the same tick you first get hit/splashed, just like the Runelite plugin.
  
	• No trample functionality. Don't get trampled. If you need it badly, DM me on twitter @chloroken.
	
	• If the keybind doesn't work or sounds don't play, run the script as an administrator.

Although the script inputs no commands and shouldn't break ToS, use at your own risk!
