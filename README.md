# Hunleff Timer Lite

A script that tracks Hunleff's attack cycles — just like the Runelite plugin `Hunleff Helper` — but with keybind activation.

DIRECTIONS:

	1) Ensure AutoHotKey is installed: https://www.autohotkey.com/
	
	2) Download and run the hunleff.ahk script as admin.
	
	3) Activate the script with [F5] as Hunleff's first attack lands.
	
	4) Reset the script with [F6] when finished.
  
NOTES:

- Default keybinds are `F5` and `F6` — check for conflicts: `Settings -> Controls` and Runelite's `Key Remapper` plugin

- No trample functionality — you'll need to reset (F6) and reactivate (F5) the plugin when Hunleff switches to ranged.

- Although the script inputs no commands and shouldn't break ToS, use at your own risk!
